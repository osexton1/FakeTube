## Project setup
All necessary files to run this project can be created by running
```
vue create <project name>
```
in the command line. This will create all top level directories and files in your directory.

You can then remove the pregenerated src file and copy the one from this repo into it, or create your own src files as preferred.

# Running the site
Use command
```
npm run serve
```
to start up the website on your local machine
