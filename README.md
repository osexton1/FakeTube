## Project setup
All necessary files to run this project can be created by running
```
vue create <project name>
```
in the terminal. This will create all top level directories and files in your directory. You can then remove the pre generated src directory and copy the one from this repo into it, or create your own src directory as preferred.

## Running the site
Use command
```
npm run serve
```
to start up the website on your local machine
