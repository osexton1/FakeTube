## Project setup
You will need to have Vue CLI installed to create the project. If you do not have Vue CLI installed, it can be installed with the following command:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

All necessary files to run this project can be created by running:
```vue
vue create <your-project-name>
```
in the terminal. This will create all top level directories and files in your directory. You can then remove the pre generated src and public directories and copy them from this repo, or create your own as preferred.

## Running the site
Use command
```
npm run serve
```
to start up the website on your local machine
